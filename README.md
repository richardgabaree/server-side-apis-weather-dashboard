The homework was challenging. Using jquery is still a challenge for me. In this homework I was able to get the information requested from the API and it will console.log out. The current weather info for the city is pull in consistantly. The 5-day forcast will consol.log out but have not been able to get it to pull into the columns. Still need to figure out how jquesy will push it to the columns. I also am struggling with the local.storage saving the cities searched and saving to the app. I feel like our project will help with that since we are including a feature like that. Over all I feel confident that the subject matter is starting to sink in but not there yet.
